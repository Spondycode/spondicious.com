			<h1>üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Totally Spondicious</h1>
			<p>
				 I created this website with Astro because it is so simple to set up.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also added Tailwind to the project and that has to be the quickest way to set up a Tailwind based site.
			</p>
			<p>What do I do? Basically lots of lovely geeky and nerdy stuff. Why? Why not... Twiddling and fiddling with technology is just loads of fun.</p>
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semi">Interesting technology</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Making websites with Astro, plain html, css, Tailwind aswell as web apps with Django and Python.</li>
				<li>I create apps for iOS, Android and Mac.
				</li>
				<li>Coding is fun, even if sometimes it can make you want to pull your hair out.</li>
				<li>Sometimes I learn some new technology just for the sake of learning something new.</li>
        <li>Mostly I play with software, but I'm also into seeing what I can do with Raspberry Pi's.</li>
        <li>Of course I am a Mac guy. I'm happy not to touch Windows even if it has got better over the years. There is some much messing about I can do with the Apple operating system and it's great that the terminal gives me linux like extra geek. There a lot of developers that use a Mac because it is so versatile and useful. I do use Linux when I play with the Raspberry Pi and also when I run up a linux cloud machine. I have used a couple of different services for that and it is not difficult to do, nor does it cost much.</li>
        <li>This website I have put on Netlify and the domain names I use Porkbun. I have another website running on the Porkbun hosting. Love it when I can make changes to a website in whichever IDE I'm using and just send the changes off using git and then Github, via <a href="/blog/Lazygit">Lazygit</a>. Only have to wait half a minute and the changes have propagated ready for the world to see.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="font-semibold ">Apps I like using...</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/blog/flutterflow">FlutterFlow</a> is my coding app of choice. It's what I use to make iOS, Android, Mac apps. Can also use for web apps, all at the same time.</li>
<li>Used to use Obsidian for all my notetaking but now my preference is <a href="/blog/craft">Craft.</a>. It is a proper native app for all the platforms where I use it.</li>
        <li><a href="/blog/kitty">Ghostty</a> is the terminal I use most, it was Kitty, but something new and shiny came along.. I also find <a href="/blog/vsconeovim">Warp</a> to be handy from time to time as it has AI built into it. Great for when you can't remember the exact terminal command to do what you need to be done.</liv>
        <li>I like the nerdiness of <a href="/blog/vsconeovim">Neovim</a> but VS Code has so many useful features. But then there is <a href="/blog/windsurf_gemini_2_flash">Windsurf</a> which also has AI built into it and I also decided to get a subscription to get the full AI action. You do get some AI without paying, but you have to copy and paste the code from Cascade into the code file.</li>
        <li>If I'm going to do any art work of any kind then I will be breaking out the <a href="/blog/affinity">Affinity apps</a> either on the Mac or the iPad. Excellent suite of apps.</li>
        <li>Just added a menubar notes app called Tot. I wanted something light and easy to get at to keep track of the small notes. Specifically the reminders I need for all of the keyboard shortcuts and combinations to use with the app launching with <a href="/blog/mac-window-management">Raycast </a>and the trickier bits to remember when using Neovim and Yazi. </li>
