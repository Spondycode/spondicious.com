## Driving Now is More than directing a big Lump of Metal

![image](EVpluggedIn.jpeg)
Interacting with the software that runs the car is a huge part of the driving experience now. I just bought a BYD Dolphin and the large screen is full of Android software. Sometimes it can be annoying and fortunately often it can be really helpful. The software will look after so many tasks and give you loads of important feed back to keep you safe on the road. It can integrate with the mechanical parts and even drive the car for you. The Dolphin does that by keeping the car in the lane even when there is a bend in the road. How cool is that? It also has a system which will look at the traffic signs and tell you when you are driving faster than what it say is the limit. On the face of it that's great to stop you getting fines for driving too fast. Hardly anyone drives completely within the speed limit. Also there are times when the limit changes, say from 70 down to 40, do you really need to hear binging and bonging every time that happens? It can drive you nuts. It is possible to stop the alerts but it has to be done each journey. Every time the car is started it resets the default back to the alerts being annoying again.

### Update

I found out a quick way to turn off the traffic light recognition. I can swipe down from the top of the screen, at a slight angle to make sure it works. It brings up a menu which I was able to customise to get the right button to turn off the traffic sign recognition. Easy... Now I can get the job done and within a couple of seconds the screen shows Apple CarPlay.

## Lovely Big Screen in the BYD Dolphin

Lots of nice things have been said about the screen in the Dolphin because it rotates. Most of the time you will leave it in Landscape mode. That's how you need to have it to use Apple Car Play. I have put it in portrait mode once so far and put it straight back into Landscape. There are a lot of switches in the car, in the doors, in a cluster under the panel and a few more below that. But the place to get a lot of stuff done in in the large screen. What would be really nice is to hack the Android system running the car and to personalise it so you can stop the bings and bongs BYD think we need to keep us safe below the speed limit.

## Connect to Wifi and Add Apps

Only just found out I can connect the car to Wifi and add extra applications to the system. I went into the app called BYD Store and saw a couple of apps available. I added a Browser and the Prime Music. It was really easy and now I have I have extra apps to enjoy in the car.

## Controlled by the software

Back to the thing with the speed notifications in the Dolphin - Every trip I have to change the setting to turn off the speed limit signs. So that is one tap to get to Home, then one to get to vehicle, then another to go to ADACS, another button to actually turn off the feature. Then I have to come back out of all of that to get back to CarPlay. It's quite annoying I can't set it once and leave the job done. Every time I start the car up again the car resets all of those setting back to the default. It is the same with the setting for the child in the car alone detection. Sometimes we have to leave the mother in law in the car when we go in the supermarket. I get notifications on the phone and then the car starts flashing lights and beeping the horn. Maybe this is something which can be sorted out in an OTA update.

## Waze ABRP or the BYD Navigation?

Prior to getting the BYD Dolphin I was strictly Waze for all my navigation needs. All of the updates to let me know if there are roadworks, speed cameras or heavy traffic are so useful. I like how it shows me on the screen the information about the upcoming junctions. However I have been looking at using A Better Route Planner ABRP. I set it up with the OBD2 Dongle to get the live data and for the moment I have a Pro version of ABRP. Good for long trips and has loads of settings to configure to set it up right for my style of travelling. How much charge I want to arrive at a charging point with, how long I need to find the charger can also be set amongst other settings. I'll give it a go and add to this document, or make a new post to go into the details.

I have also looked and the BYD navigation and it looks pretty good. I set it to give me a route to Paris and obviously I would need to charge along the way. It gave me a route and suggeted places for me to stop. I will definitely look into it more and see how it performs. Maybe it will work well enough that I don't need to use ABRP.

## EV's are Cheap to Run

I fill up the battery at home and often I can do it for free. I have solar panels on the roof and a home battery of 5kWh's. I am a data freak and I like to track the charging of the car. So I have created a app which is in the Apple App Store. It is called EV Data and it tracks the charging of the car. I can see how much I have charged and I'm really pleased with it and I think you will be too.
