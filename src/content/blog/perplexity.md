## I got Perplexity Pro Free for One Year

I was trying out Perplxity on my Mac and iPhone and happened to see an email from the mobile phone company which I would usually ignore which was offering Perplexity Pro free for 12 months. I was already fairly impressed with Perplexity, so it was a no-brainer to make use of the offer.

## What Can You Do With Perplexity?

Well you ask it all sorts of questions like you would ask a search engine. I have noticed that the searches I do using Duck Duck Go are more intelligent. Often the first section give me a load of information about my search rather than just a bunch of links to websites I could go and get that information. It's kind of a summary of what could be found in those websites. With Perplexity that is the whole thing of what it does. What is great about it is that you get the first answer and then you can jump back with a related question. You can just keep on going until you have answers to all your questions.

## How do you use Perplexity

Basically you ask it questions about whatever you want to know about. It will give you answers and you can add supplemental questions to go deeper into whatever the subject is. It knows what you asked before so you don't have to keep asking the same questions over and over. It really builds on top of answers it gave before and expands depending on what you ask next. It's impressive.
