## Flutterflow Is Really Impressive

After spending a lot of time Learning python and Django I jumped into Flutterflow. It is absolutely marvelous and I think it is the way that most software coding should go in the future. I often thought when starting a new Django project that much of it could be automated. I was having to do the same things over and over again. I did try to create a GitHub repository with a basic start-up for a Django project, but it wasn’t enough.

It does help to have a basic coding understanding to use with Flutterflow. As you still need to work out the logic to make the application work. It’s really impressive that much of the coding is drag and drop of components. With the way it works it’s surprising how fast you can create an application. I’m talking about an application which works and is useful and not just something which looks like it would work.

In the past I did try learning Swift and that’s even more difficult to learn than Python and Django. The problem with Django is that is difficult to get it converted into an app you can use on iOS or Android. It’s really good to have an coding application you can use to do all of it. The apps I have created have worked on both iOS and Android and I’ve also made a Mac versions of the same applications. Not only that, at the same time I’ve put it out so it works on the web.

It does cost a monthly subscription to use Flutterflow, but it is so worth it! It’s just the cost of doing business and making applications. You can try it out for free, then there is a level which gives you more facilities to work with. On top of that there is a pro level which is the one that I use. I wanted to have the version of Flutterflow which would let me put my applications into the Google play store and the iOS app store much easier. So far that’s worked out well with the iOS Applications but I’m still having difficulty getting things into Google Play.
