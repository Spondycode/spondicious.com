## Neovim is great for text editing

When you spend the time to learn the amazing text editing tricks you can do with just the keyboard in Neovim, you want use it for all your work with text. Not having to reach for the mouse every 10 seconds is such a time saver. You can get at your files as easy as you can with VS Code. Already you are based in your terminal, so that's a plus. So you could have another terminal tab, window, or be running Tmux to have quick access to Git through LazyGit perhaps. There are plugins to take care of much of the nitty gritty for coding, although I find them more fiddly to set up. But is it enough?

## VS Code makes it all so simple though...

If you can't give the time to learn the key bindings of Neovim, then there some shortcuts in VSCode and the mouse. So you can still be pretty quick. Having the Git facilities and a terminal built in is handy also.
