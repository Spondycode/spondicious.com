title: 'Starting a Software Company'
---

This year, I took a leap into the unknown and applied for and got the Estonian E-residency. The main reason behind this was to start my own software company. By choosing the Estonian route, I was able to speed things up, save money, and do it all in English - something that wouldn’t have been possible if I had set up a Spanish company in Spain, where I currently reside. The process was mostly online, but I did have to visit the Barcelona Estonian consulate to pick up the E-residency kit in person. All in all, it cost me around €500 to set up the company and complete the process. On the other hand, I’ve heard that setting up a company in Spain would have set me back between €3000 and €4000. That’s a significant difference! While I could have continued working as a freelancer, there are some advantages to having a company when submitting my apps to the Google Play Store. Plus, I’m a tech enthusiast, and I can write off certain expenses as business-related, like buying a new computer. The company owns it, but I get to use it and enjoy it.

## Spondycode Applications

Approximately a year ago, I resigned from my position as a receptionist at a campsite where I had worked for about 15 years. This experience has provided me with valuable insights into the campsite industry.
Several campsites offer applications to their customers, enabling them to connect with the campsite business. The manager of the campsite where I was employed expressed a desire to have an application for the business, but she also expressed concerns about its high cost.
In response to this, I decided to explore the possibility of developing a customisable application that could be utilised by multiple campsites. By adopting this approach, I could reduce costs and make the application more affordable by incorporating user-visible content. As a software developer, I am eager to create the application, but I am also mindful of the time required to add extensive data.

## False Start With Django And Python

My first attempts into creating software I used Python and Django. I learned a lot and enjoyed creating web based applications. I soon realised that it wasn’t the way to go for creating Applications for iOS, Android or for Mac and Windows. Then I found I could create Mobile apps using Flutter and I actually created example applications. By following a tutorial. Not long after that I discovered Flutterflow which is a no code or low code solution to creating applications. I am absolutely delighted with this tool and it wasn’t long after starting with the free to use version that I became a pro user began paying for it monthly. I’ve also recently changed to an annual payment which seems like a lot to pay for all in one go, but brings down the per month cost by €20. The time I spent using python and Django was not completely wasted. Using a no code or low code solution works better if you understand the programming/coding way of thinking.

There are other ways to do coding, other low code solutions, such as Bubble and now also using AI. I have recently seen videos where people show how they use AI in applications like the code editor Windsurf or with Bolt. Again, to get the best out of these solutions it’s a good idea to understand coding. You need to have the language in order to tell the AI what do you want it to do.

## What Have I Made So Far?

I started by making an application I thought it would be good for camping enthusiasts. The users are able to add their favourite campsites, organised camping places which are not campsites and also wild camping spots. I also added in it away for the users to make contact between themselves. So in some way it was a kind of social network for people who like camping. Users can add ratings for their favourite spots and leave reviews. I had a facility in it where they could use What 3 Words as a way to mark accurately, to within 3m their favourite places for camping.

Next application I made was a customer service to be used by camping sites. They replaced for the way they turned out and all I have to do is go and sell it to the businesses. I have been able to put this on my iPhone and other people’s phones using Testflight. It feels great to see an app I’ve created on actual devices.

My latest app is for campers and camping sites - Campings Spain. It started off has an app for camping in Costa Brava and then I thought I would make it cover Catalonia, then I thought I might as well go for the whole of Spain. My idea of this one is to use it to make a connection with the camping sites in Spain. Within the application I will let them know that I can make an application for them just for their campsite. This application is going to be cheap or free for the users of the application. Free users will get the basic information and then I’ll have a pro Version of the application for a small sum of money which will give users access to more. Then the plan is to get it so that campsites can give me a subscription for them to have page with photos extra to the basic page. I’ll probably give them another page as well they can use to give the touristic spiel to attract them to the campsite.

## Will It Be Successful As A Business?

Who knows? Obviously is not going to be as easy as it was when the first iPhones were available. There are a lot of people making applications these days. However, I think I have which could be exploited due to my insight knowledge of the business. It’s worth giving it a try. In any case, I’ve had a lot of fun learning how to code with Python, Django and FlutterFlow creating these applications.
