## Getting my first app fully published on the Apple App Store

This is a simple project to get me started with app development. It is a simple app which shows information about a movie. The app is created in FlutterFlow and I kept it simple to make it easier to get it out on the App Store. It is an app to scratch my own itch. I like to keep data about the TV Series and movies I watch in Craft. I did have a plugin in Obsidian to get information about movies and TV Series, but with me now using Craft it was just adding an extra step to get the data into the app. Also I was having to send the extracted data from Obsidian into another app to clean it up for insertion into Craft. So I decided to make a simple app which would just get what I wanted and put it into the clipboard. Then it is a simple paste into Craft. I still don't have the format totally right, but I can work on that.What comes in now is good as far as the data is concerned and I can use the AI in Craft to clean it up.

## How it Works

The user opens the app and sees a nice looking loading screen. Then it lands on the home page, where you can search for a movie, TV Series if you already have the API Key in the app. There is a menu item below where the user can get to a page with a link to get a free API Key. When in the home screen you add the IMDB ref which is the IMDB number of the movie and often looks like this - tt0172495. I get this reference by going to the IMDB app and running a shortcut from the Shortcuts app. 
In my app there is a button - Get Details. When you click that, the app goes off and gets the details for the movie. The details I want are displayed in a section below and puts the data in the clipboard for pasting into Craft. It can be a movie or a TV Series.

I have set this as a free app and it will be available on the App Store soon. It is good to have a simple app like this to scratch my own itch. Setting it up was easy enough and only took a couple of days. Learned a few thing along the way about how to get data from an API in FlutterFlow. Finding how it goes for getting an app on the App Store is priceless.
