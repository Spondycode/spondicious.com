## I used to like Obsidian & What is this Quartz

One of the cool things about [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or Logseq is the graph view. That little graphic that shows all the links between the notes. Sometimes you see connections in the graph view that take you by surprise. An unheard of benefit of this type of notetaking. Increasing your understanding of all the knowledge you are gathering together. Linking the nodes of information together is the superpower of great PKM apps. It kind mimics the way our brains work. Yesterday I found Quartz which has the graph linky thing. It isn't as easy to make the links in Quartz as it is in the apps I have already mentioned or my chosen notes app, Craft. In Quartz you have to know the name of the file that you want to link to. Not like in Craft when you hit the @ key or [[ keys to do the same and the app searches for documents and also blocks in the documents. Quartz is still cool though.

## What can you do with Quartz

If you want a sort of a Wiki online for an educational purpose. Send data to students or members of your club or whatever. Let them jump from document to document and get a great understanding of whatever the subject is. I made a Quartz about characters from the Beano comic. Are there any legit links between Minnie the Minx and Desperate Dan, the cow pie eating strong man.

It is easy to set up a Quartz site. I did it by downloading the full set of files from [Gitub](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz?tab=readme-ov-file) as a zip. I have to do some installing and it was up and running as quick as you like. npm i was the command I used in the Terminal. I could have followed instructions on the [website](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and done it a different way but my way worked better for me.
